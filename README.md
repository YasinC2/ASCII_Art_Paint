# Simple interface

The editor has basic functionality and an interface similar to most popular graphic editors for more convenient use.
You can use drag and drop to open a file. The usual txt file format is used to load and save data, which ensures full compatibility with other text editors.

# Adapting bitmaps

If you open a bitmap in the editor, it will be displayed on the background of the canvas and can be used as a template or example to redraw the image into text symbols.

# Customizable symbol palette

Using the built-in symbol table, you can get all the available symbols of a font in the selected range and use them to create your own symbol palette.
You can specify a symbol to draw without using the palette, but using the keyboard, including using keyboard shortcuts for special symbols. Optionally, you can load multiple fonts from .ttf, .woff and .woff2 files and use them instead of the default font.

# Image to text conversion

You can convert a bitmap image to text format by specifying the size and symbols palette, from the symbol for the darkest color to the symbol for the lightest color.
Thus, you have complete control over the conversion process to get the most suitable result.
